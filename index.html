  <meta name="description" content="Christ said, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls” (Matt. 11:28–29). This book examines the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ and the incidents of His life. It is a witness of Him as the divine Son of God. As a witness, this book invites all to come unto Him with their burdens and challenges in order to find peace in their lives." />

            <p>
              The four volumes of this book explore the life of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as told through
              the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It is a witness of Him as the divine Son of God. As
              a witness, this book invites all to come unto Him with their burdens and challenges in order to
              find peace in their lives. It invites all who read it to gain or strengthen their own testimonies and
              to gain additional insights of their own as Christ’s words and miracles are pondered and
              individual inspiration is sought.
            </p><p>
              This volume, the first in a four-part series, begins by providing foundational context, particularly
              through discussing Christ’s premortal life, examining Old Testament prophecies of Him, and
              presenting a brief history of ancient Israel. The book then uses the New Testament’s Gospel
              accounts—supplemented with other scriptures and recognized authoritative sources—to present
              details and insights regarding His birth, His developmental years, and the beginning of His ministry.
            </p><p>
              Subsequent volumes will explore Jesus’s Galilean ministry, His ministry in Judea and Perea, the
              final week of His life, including His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, atoning sacrifice, illegal
              trials and ultimate crucifixion and resurrection. The final volume will contain an extended
              Appendix which explores and discusses Christ’s ministry in the Americas.
            </p><p>
              This book is an ideal resource for individual in-depth study of Jesus Christ, including His ministry, 
              teachings, and miracles. This volume, as well as future volumes, can also be used as a springboard for 
              inspiring family discussions about the Savior of the world.

              This book is a powerful witness of the Savior. It Chronicles His life and ministry in a well documented account of not only the events of His life, but the importance of His role in the Father's plan.
            </p><p>
              This is an excellent book for those seeking to know and understand the life of Jesus Christ and His divine role as Savior of the World. The book is meticulously researched for historical accuracy and is well written for all to read and understand. I gained many new insights into the events surrounding Christ's life and death and would highly recommend this read to anyone.
            </p><p>
              This book left me with no doubt who Jesus Christ is, His Divinity and divine mission. Many insights were gained into the life of Jesus Christ and surrounding events. Learning of Jesus Christ always inspires me to be a little better and do a little better and this book does just that. There are many books out there on Jesus Christ, I'd suggest this one to be at the top of your list. Well worth the read.
